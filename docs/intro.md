# Getting Started
LinkTracker is a tool that as you may have guessed allows developers to track the links that players join through. LinkTracker can be implemented in quite a few ways and if you are interested in some use cases here are some [examples](/LinkTracker/docs/examples).

:::warning Temporary Links
As of v1.0.0 temporary links that are created in studio will not transfer over to the game.
