# About
LinkTracker is a tool that as you may have guessed allows developers to track the links that players join through. LinkTracker can be implemented in quite a few ways and if you are interested in some use cases you can download [examples](https://github.com/re-sync-dev/LinkTracker/releases) from the releases page.

:::warning Temporary Links
As of v1.0.0 temporary links that are created in studio will not transfer over to the game.

## Why use LinkTracker?
### Analytics
Using LinkTracker can help you understand where your audience comes from whether that be [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/) or even a [Discord](https://discord.com/) server.

### Advertisement
Instead of paying for a post, developers / project managers can pay per visit or even give the creator a percentage of the amount someone in their audience has spent in game.

### Better Q/A testing
For larger studios Q/A testing is highly recommended, but if the game becomes public in any way friends of testers or random players can join the experience. You can get around this by having a hard coded list of users that can join OR using LinkTracker you can set the amount of users that can join through that link and kick anybody without the link.

### User Private Links
Roblox has a builtin feature that allows users to invite their friends to a game, but some users might want something a bit more private for games in the RPG / RolePlay genre it could be a QoL feature for a player to send over a link and the player who joins will be able to join for example a guild if they so choose because they used that direct link.

### Server Based Games
Most games utilize an invite system where you have to join the game and then join the specific server, which while works can become tedious for some players. LinkTracker would be able to create a link for that server that another player could join through.
